# Pinned to the BUILD platform, not the target: the image is published
# multi-arch, and letting the toolchain stage run under QEMU emulation to
# produce an arm64 binary is minutes of emulated compilation for no reason. Go
# cross-compiles natively instead, driven by the TARGET* args buildx injects.

# BuildKit sets both for the target platform, the host's for a plain
# `docker build` without --platform; the TARGETOS default just restates linux.
#
# BuildKit is required either way — `$BUILDPLATFORM` on the FROM above is a
# BuildKit-only variable, and the legacy builder fails to parse the line rather
# than ignoring it. That is the default builder since Docker 23, so this only
# bites an explicit DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0.
